php index.php tools DBTools CountCompanyRecords <company_id>
  Search the database for tables that have a column called “CompanyId”.
  Those tables are then checked for records that have a value matching the
  company_id passed in.  The resulting report will show you how many records
  belong to the target company in each table.  This tool can be used to
  make sure all data is being cleaned up appropriately during a rollback.
