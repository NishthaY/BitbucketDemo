If a database is "reset", a company can be deleted without
having disabled the AWS encryption keys.  Since we pay monthly
for those keys, this tool will find those lost keys and schedule
them for removal.

By default, this application will delete them after a 7 day
waiting period.  You may select a waiting period between 7-30
days if you want by adding an additional parameter.
