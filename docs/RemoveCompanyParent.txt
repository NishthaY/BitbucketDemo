USAGE:
    php index.php tools RemoveCompanyParent
    php index.php tools RemoveCompanyParent remove

Remove one or all parents in the current runtime environment.
Please note, this is super destructive.  You will not only
purge the database of this parent, but S3 files and IAM
security keys as well.

NOTE: This will not remove companies associated with the parent.
They will still exist and no longer be bound to a parent.
