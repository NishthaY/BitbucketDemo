USAGE:
    php index.php tools RemoveCompanies
    php index.php tools RemoveCompanies execute

This tool can be used as a way to remove a large batch of companies that have been
generated on various test levels.  When this interactive script is executed all
companies and parent companies will be removed except for the Transamerica
parent company, all of the children companies of Transamerica and the Advice2Pay
company.

In development, this script can easily be modified to fit a different set of
removal requirements.  I suggest you review the code before you run this script
to make sure developers have not changed the hard coded values.  This is an interactive
tool so you will be asked to confirm the removals.

Please, do not delete the Advice2Pay company ( company_id=1 ).
